# Switch expressions tutorial
2 player game provided as an example, make the tests go green for the 3 player version as well!
## TODO:
Use switch expressions and case guards to make the PlayWith3Players function pass all the unit tests.
Requirements are defined by the given unit tests but in short:
- single "winner" (for example rock, paper, rock => rock wins)
- single shotgun should throw exception
- otherwise shotguns have draws just as the other options

## BONUS:
Make the tests go green without switch expressions using just one function :)
