# CSharp Tutorials
This repository will contain some short Code KATA type projects with pre-existing
unit tests and short instructions for trying out various C# features in practice.

## How?
Unit tests cover the basic requirements for the simple tutorials but of course anyone
is free to build more elaborate cases yourself.

So, in short: **Make all the unit tests pass by using the features that you want to learn and practice.**

## Requirements
.NET Core 3.1 SDK is required to have support for C# 8 and for compiling code and running tests.
